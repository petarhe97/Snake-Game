Peter's Snake Game

	This is a game where the player must go around and collect fruits as the snake. The more fruits the snake eats, the bigger he becomes. The score is 

calculated on how many fruits the snake has collected, and there is no end, the game ends when the player dies.

The player can die when the snake either goes out of bounds, or eats itself (the snake runs into its own body).

The game is made solely to compare scores between friends, and a good time waster.

The player can preset the framerate and snake speed in command line, it is highly recommanded to start at a low speed because 

high speed is extremely hard. (speed goes from 1 to 10)

The final score will be displayed in the terminal, along with an exit message.

Controls:

W A S D to move up, left, down, right

It is made so that the player moves the snake in the player's perspective (move left means moving to the player's right).

To start the game from splash screen, press S and wait (reason in grading notice).

To pause the game, press p.

To restart the game, press r.

To quit the game at any time, press q.

Enhancements:

	The game has its own graphic textures. The snake is made out of blocks of stars, the target fruit is a strawberry, and the background is a grassfield.

Development Environment:

	macOS Sierra (version 10.12)

	MacBook Air 2015

Grading Notice:

	There is a noticeable delay between the splash screen and the game starting. Reason is currently unknown. The instructor has told me on piazza that 

it is not very relevant to the grading, so please go easy on me. (quoting Terence Dickson)

The delay does not affect gameplay at all, and the splashscreen can be turned off easily by going to Line 40 of the code, and changing gameStart boolean to true.
